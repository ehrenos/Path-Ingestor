# Path-Ingestor
A Burp-Suite extension, which takes paths from HTTP requests and adds the unique ones to a chosen text file. It supports both live checking and sitemap ingestion.

### Disclaimer
Heed my warning, this was heavily vibe-coded. I assume no responsibility for existing word lists. Make a back-up.

## Usage
Load your chosen file, the results of it will populate on the left hand of the extension screen. Choose your output file and save when you feel like it.

You can choose to ingest a site map if you don't trust the live feature, that would be valid. Otherwise you can save the contents to the chosen text file with the save button.

If you need additional support, then this extension isn't your biggest problem
